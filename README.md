# Welcome to Itera's "Web and React Intro" course!

Throughout this course you'll get to learn a bit about basic React concepts and
how you can wield them to create your own web app. The goal of this course is to
give you a brief overview of React; enough for you to feel comfortable about
reading and writing React code in the wild ðŸ”¥.

Additionally, the course is also meant to give you an even briefer introduction
to general web development and how we have arrived at the present situation
regarding "Modern Web Development". The intention here is for you to be able to
navigate through the quagmire that we call frontend.
